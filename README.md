# Vegetable Image Classification with PyTorch CNN
## Introduction
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for image classification tasks, offering remarkable performance in various domains, including agriculture. This report explores the application of CNNs to vegetable image classification, where images are categorized into different classes based on vegetable types.

## Aim
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of CNNs in vegetable image classification, leveraging a dataset comprising 21,000 images distributed across 15 distinct classes representing different types of vegetables. By training robust models capable of accurately categorizing vegetables, this study contributes to the advancement of computer vision techniques in agricultural applications, fostering efficiency and precision in vegetable classification processes.

## Data Preprocessing
Necessary libraries are imported and the dataset is downloaded from Kaggle using the opendatasets library. After exploring the dataset's structure, the images are preprocessed for training by defining transformations such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

## Model Configuration
The model is configured to utilize available GPU resources for computation and a CNN architecture is defined specifically tailored for vegetable image classification. Functions for model training and evaluation are implemented, allowing optimization of model parameters and performance monitoring.

## Training and Result Analysis
The model is trained for multiple epochs, with performance metrics such as training loss, validation loss, and accuracy monitored. The training process is analyzed through visualizations of accuracy vs. epochs, loss vs. epochs, and learning rate vs. batch number.

## Predictions and Evaluation
Sample images from the test set are used to demonstrate the model's capability to classify vegetable images. The overall loss and accuracy of the model on the test set are computed to assess its performance.

## Saving the Model
The trained model's state dictionary is saved to disk for future use, facilitating easy reloading of the model.

## Future Works
Potential future improvements include exploring advanced architectures like ResNet-9, implementing transfer learning techniques, and deploying the model on the web for broader accessibility.

## Summary
In conclusion, the CNN model achieves an impressive 81% accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating its proficiency in vegetable image classification tasks. With potential applications in agriculture for quality control, inventory management, and product classification, the model represents a significant milestone in the field of computer vision for agriculture. Further refinements and explorations can lead to even higher accuracies and broader deployment in real-world scenarios. Overall, this project showcases the effectiveness of CNNs in vegetable image classification tasks.
